# Real-World Applications of RSA Encryption

## Secure Cloud Storage and Data Privacy

### Cloud Service Provider Data Protection
1. **Zero-Knowledge Storage**
   - Data is encrypted before reaching cloud servers
   - Cloud providers cannot access or read your data
   - Only you hold the decryption keys
   - Perfect for sensitive business information

2. **Real-World Examples**
   - **Healthcare**: 
     - Patient records encrypted before cloud storage
     - Medical imaging data protection
     - Lab results and diagnoses security
     - Only authorized healthcare providers can decrypt

   - **Financial Services**:
     - Banking transaction records
     - Investment portfolio data
     - Client financial information
     - Trading algorithms and strategies

   - **Enterprise**:
     - Intellectual property documents
     - Employee personal data
     - Business strategy documents
     - Client contracts and agreements

### Cloud Database Security
1. **Database Encryption Layers**
   - **Column-Level Encryption**:
     - Specific sensitive columns encrypted
     - Different keys for different data types
     - Example: Credit card numbers, SSNs, personal data

   - **Row-Level Encryption**:
     - Individual records encrypted
     - User-specific encryption keys
     - Perfect for multi-tenant applications

2. **Practical Applications**
   - **E-commerce Platforms**:
     ```
     Customer Data -> RSA Encryption -> Cloud Database
     - Payment information
     - Shipping addresses
     - Purchase history
     - Account credentials
     ```

   - **SaaS Applications**:
     ```
     Business Data -> RSA Encryption -> Cloud Storage
     - User accounts
     - Business metrics
     - Client information
     - Usage analytics
     ```
